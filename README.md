# Multiclass-Heart-Disease-Classification


Heart diseases are one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world.This makes heart diseases a major concern to be dealt with. However, it's difficult to treat them because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors.Of all the applications of machine-learning, diagnosing any serious disease using a black box is always going to be a hard sell. If the output from a model is the course of treatment (potentially with side-effects), or surgery, or the absence of treatment, people are going to want to know why.

The dataset provided by UCI can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/) and in partiuclar, I will be using the clevland data for the prediction of presence or absence of the disease. It consists of 13 independent features and the target variable which either represents a healthy person(H) or a a diseased patient (S1,S2,S3,S4)
